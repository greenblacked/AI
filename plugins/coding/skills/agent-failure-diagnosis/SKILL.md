# Agent Failure Diagnosis

A diagnosis is finished when one recurring failure has a named layer of the environment, the captured runs that show it, one change at that layer, and a rerun showing the failure gone while an unrelated case stayed as it was.

The job is hard because the agent is the visible part of the failure and the environment is the cause. A rule file the host never loaded, a check that cannot run in the agent's shell, a constraint that scrolled out of a long session: each looks, from the outside, like an agent that did not listen. The reflex answer is another paragraph of instructions. That paragraph costs context in every future session, competes with every other rule, and does nothing when the real fault was a missing binary. The order below makes you find the layer before you touch anything.

## Scope

Use for: one failure that recurs in one working repository, in the words people use for it: "it keeps forgetting X", "it says done but nothing works", "it ignores the rules file", "same mistake every session", "why does the agent do this".

Do not use for: a red CI run, which is `ci-triage`; untrusted content steering a tool call, which is `agent-security-review`; measuring many runs against a sealed dataset to decide whether a change ships, which is `agent-evaluation`; briefing a new task, which is `agent-delegation`; an ordinary defect in the product code, which is `debugging`. This skill starts from a repeating behaviour of the agent and ends at a change to what the agent works inside.

## Hard gates

1. No capture, no diagnosis. A theory formed from one remembered incident explains the incident the author remembers, which is rarely the one that recurs.
2. Each failure is attributed to exactly one layer. A failure that fits two layers is two failures and gets two rows in the log.
3. One change per rerun. Two changes that together fix it leave you not knowing which one to keep, and the unneeded one stays in the repository for good.
4. Three consecutive changes that do not move the result mean the attribution is wrong. Stop changing things and re-attribute from fresh captures.

## What the words mean in each host

A **fresh session** is one that starts from the repository on disk with none of the earlier conversation. In Claude Code that is a newly started session in the repository, which reads `CLAUDE.md` and the project rules itself. In Codex or ChatGPT it is a new task or thread against the repository, which starts from `AGENTS.md`. Reusing the old session for a rerun proves nothing: it still holds the correction you just gave it.

A **subagent** is a helper that reads in its own context and returns a report, so a bulky trace never enters yours. In Claude Code, `agent-run-trace-reader` is one (read-only tools, returns an evidence ledger). Where the host has no such thing, read the trace yourself in bounded sections, or start a second fresh thread given only the trace file and the question, and treat what it returns as a claim to check rather than a finding.

## Workflow

### 1. Capture before theorising

Collect two or three separate runs of the failure. For each, keep the transcript or trace the host provides, and the diff the run produced. Take the diff against the commit the run started from, and list untracked files separately, because a plain `git diff` omits them:

```bash
git diff "$BASE_SHA" > "$CAPTURE_DIR/case-1.diff"
git status --short > "$CAPTURE_DIR/case-1.untracked.txt"
```

Keep captures outside the working tree so they cannot leak into a commit or into the next run. Record for each: date, model and effort when the host shows them, the starting commit, the request as worded, and what the agent claimed at the end.

A transcript longer than you can read in one pass goes to `agent-run-trace-reader` in Claude Code, or to bounded reading elsewhere. Ask for the ledger around the failing point: the calls, their returns, and which claims have no evidence behind them. Attribution stays with you, because the reader makes no decisions.

If only one run exists, or the failure cannot be shown, stop. Ask for the next occurrence to be saved, and say what to save. Do not diagnose from memory.

### 2. Rule out the cheaper explanations

Settle these before any layer, because none is a fault in the environment and each has a different owner:

- **The request was ambiguous.** Give the captured request to someone who has not seen the run and ask what they would deliver. A different answer means the request failed, not the harness.
- **The repository really is broken.** Check out the starting commit in a clean worktree and run the check the agent was meant to pass, with no agent involved. A failure there is a product defect for `debugging`.
- **The model or effort did not suit the task.** If a stronger tier at the same setup passes the same case, the failure is a tier choice. That is a cost decision, not something to patch with rules.
- **It happened once.** A single occurrence is not a pattern. Wait for the second capture.

Read `references/layer-decision-table.md` when a capture seems to fit none of these and none of the layers below.

### 3. Attribute each failure to one layer

Find the earliest point in the capture where a different input would have changed the outcome, and ask what the agent had in front of it at that moment. Then match the signal:

| Signal in the capture | Layer | First fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The rule is absent, contradicts another, or a fresh session cannot quote it back | Instructions | Make the host load it, then remove the contradiction, then shorten. Adding text is last. |
| A command was not found, ran from the wrong directory, hit a denied action, or needed a dependency that is not there | Tools and permissions | Fix the environment the agent runs in, or grant the narrowest permission the task needs. |
| A constraint from early in the session is violated late, or the agent acts on information that is no longer true | State and context | Shorten the task, write the constraint where each fresh session reads it, record decisions durably. |
| Nothing exists that would show the result is wrong, or the check passes while the result is wrong | Verification | Add or strengthen a check the agent can run and cannot edit away. |
| The task spans many concerns, or nobody defined what "done" is | Scope | Split the task and write a runnable done-check. |

To tell instructions from the rest cheaply, ask a fresh session what the project instructions say about the rule, without hinting. A session that cannot quote it was never given it, and wording is not the problem. A session that quotes it and still breaks it points to another layer.

When a failure fits two layers, split it. Log both, change one first, and leave the other for its own turn under gate 3.

Read `references/layer-decision-table.md` for the full table of signals, the check that confirms each, and how to split a failure that fits two layers.

### 4. Change one thing at the attributed layer

Make the smallest change that would have prevented the failure at that layer. Then rerun, each in a fresh session started at the same commit:

- every captured case, with the same model and effort as the original;
- one control: a case that should be unaffected by the change.

A control that changes means the change was broader than intended. Agents vary from run to run, so a case that passes once has not shown the fix works. Repeat each case enough times that a pass is not luck, and report counts, not impressions.

Keep a log with one row per attempt: failure, layer, evidence, change, result. Read `references/diagnosis-log.md` for the template and a worked example in which the first attribution was wrong.

### 5. Apply the stop rules

Three consecutive changes that do not move the result mean the attribution is wrong, not that the changes were too timid. Revert the three, since they changed the repository and bought nothing, and capture two or three fresh failing runs. The old captures are the ones your theory was fitted to. Read them again from the start without the theory, then attribute again.

Adding more instruction text is the weakest fix and goes last. A written rule is advice the agent can skip, it consumes context in every session, and it leaves no signal when it fails. A check that fails, a tool that exists, or a task small enough to hold in view works without the agent's cooperation. Where the instructions layer is the true cause, repair what is already there first: load it, deduplicate it, resolve the contradiction.

### 6. Route the fix to the skill that owns it

| Layer | Hand the fix to |
| --- | --- |
| Instructions: wording, structure, what the file should contain | `agent-instructions` |
| Enforcement: a check, hook or permission that makes the failure impossible rather than discouraged | `agent-guardrails` |
| Scope: a task too large, or "done" undefined | `agent-delegation` |
| State: lost progress, stale information, a long session | `agent-handoff` |
| Proof that the fix holds across a dataset of cases rather than the captured few | `agent-evaluation` |

A denied action or a failing check is information about a boundary someone drew on purpose. Do not widen a permission, skip a hook or weaken a check to make a failure disappear. Decide first whether the boundary was right; if it was, the fix is to give the agent a sanctioned way to do the work.

## Output format

Report a diagnosis in this shape:

```markdown
## Verdict
[The recurring failure, the layer, and whether the last rerun cleared it.]

## Captures
[The cases used, each with date, starting commit and what the agent claimed.]

## Ruled out
[Ambiguity, repository defect, model or effort: what was checked and the result.]

## Attribution
[Layer per failure, with the transcript evidence. Split failures listed separately.]

## Changes tried
[The log: failure, layer, evidence, change, result. Reverted changes marked.]

## Next
[The owning skill for any remaining fix, or what to capture next.]
```

## Anti-patterns

**Adding a rule for every miss.** The instruction file grows until the rule that matters is one of fifty and the agent follows the early ones. Each addition feels like progress and none leaves evidence that it worked.

**Rerunning in the same session.** The agent now knows the answer, so the rerun passes for a reason unrelated to the change. Start fresh each time.

**Diagnosing from the final message.** The agent said it ran the tests. Read the calls and their returns, not the summary of them.

**Fixing two layers at once.** The failure stops and nobody knows why, so the next recurrence has no starting point.

**Tuning to the captured cases.** The change passes the three runs it was designed against and nothing else. The control case and a fresh capture are what show whether it generalises.

**Treating a denial as an obstacle.** A blocked write or a refused command reads as the cause of the failure. It is a boundary; check it before routing around it.
