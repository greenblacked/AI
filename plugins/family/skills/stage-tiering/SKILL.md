Covers where each is set, which setting beats an environment override, and how to opt out. Written in tiers, not product models.

# Stage tiering

The stages are tiered when each FAMILY agent runs on the model and effort its stage's cost of error calls for, the choice is written in the agent's own file rather than remembered, parallel fan-out is capped at two agents on disjoint questions, and the main conversation has a named step where their returns become one decision.

The failure runs in both directions. Every stage on the top tier spends the expensive model on throwaway reading: the survey of a codebase costs fifty files to produce two sentences. Every stage on a cheap tier puts the weak model where being wrong costs most, at the architecture whose key decision is hard to reverse, and at the inspection that is the one independent check. Tiering by what an error costs at that stage, rather than by habit, fixes both.

## Scope

Use for: choosing the model and effort for each FAMILY agent; deciding how many agents to run at once; deciding what the main conversation does with their returns; explaining why a setting did or did not take effect.

Do not use for: estimating or reducing API spend, prompt caching or model routing inside a product, which is `llm-cost`; coordinating several live coding agents on one repository task, which is `agent-orchestration`; briefing one agent, which is `agent-delegation`; or the stage definitions, which are `family-workflow`.

## The rule

| Stage | Agent | Tier | Effort | Why an error here is bounded or not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frame | `framer` | mid | medium | Reads and organises; Architect returns `NEEDS FRAME` if it is wrong |
| Architect | `architect` | top | tool default | Names the hard-to-reverse decision; nothing downstream re-derives it |
| Make | `maker` | mid | medium | A plan; Inspect and the plan check catch a bad one |
| Inspect | `inspector` | top | tool default | The independent check; a weak one passes defects through |
| Launch | `launcher` | mid | medium | A checklist read; its gate is written and owned |
| Yield | `yielder` | mid | medium | A retro; a poor one is corrected by the next |

The tiers are relative: mid is the capable, economical model your tool offers, and top is its most capable one. You map them; this skill names no product. Raise a mid stage one tier when nothing downstream re-reads its output, for example Launch on a migration that cannot be rolled back. Never lower architect or inspector. Read `references/tier-table.md` for the reasoning per stage and for where each setting lives.

## Workflow

### 1. Read the agent file

Open each agent's file and check its `model` and `effort` keys. A file with neither takes `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` when that variable is set and otherwise inherits the main conversation's model, which is usually the top tier, so the survey stages overspend until you set them.

### 2. Set the tier where the agent is defined

Write `model` and `effort` in the agent's frontmatter. A value there wins over an environment-level override, so the tiering holds for anyone who set one for other reasons. Read `references/tier-table.md` for the order of precedence and how to opt out.

### 3. Cap the fan-out at two

Run at most two survey agents in parallel, on questions that do not overlap. The stage being served, for example architect drafting beside two claim agents, is not one of the two. Two overlapping returns leave the main conversation to reconcile them, which costs more than the reading saved. Read `references/fan-out.md` for how to split a question and what disjoint means.

### 4. Name the synthesis step

After a fan-out, the main conversation does one named step: read both returns, reconcile them, and state the decision in a paragraph before the next stage starts. The decision stays in the main conversation, because it depends on the session and travels badly through a cold prompt.

### 5. Record the opt-out if you take it

A user who wants one model everywhere may. Say so where the team will see it, because it removes the tiering silently.

## Anti-patterns

**Everything on the top tier.** The survey stages overspend, and nobody notices because the output is the same.

**The cheap architect.** The hard-to-reverse decision made by the model chosen for being cheap.

**Three in parallel.** More returns than anyone reads closely, with overlapping answers.

**Synthesis by omission.** Two returns pasted forward with no step that decides between them.

**Vendor names in the rule.** A table of product models that is wrong by the next release; write tiers and map them.
