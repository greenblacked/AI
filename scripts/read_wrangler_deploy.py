"""Read the workers.dev URL out of a Wrangler deploy or preview log.

Wrangler appends one JSON object per line when ``WRANGLER_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH`` is set.
The line with ``"type": "deploy"`` carries ``targets``, the URLs that version is
served at. This prints ``url=`` and, when Wrangler sent one, ``version_id=`` in the
form ``GITHUB_OUTPUT`` expects, and nothing else on stdout. It also prints
``custom_url=https://ai.szolotov.com`` when a target is that custom domain as Wrangler
renders it, ``ai.szolotov.com (custom domain)`` with its optional zone and flag
suffixes and no scheme: the release checks that line to know this deploy attached the
custom domain, because it cannot fetch that domain from a GitHub runner (Bot Fight Mode
answers it with a 403).

A target is accepted only as ``https`` on a ``workers.dev`` host, with no user, port,
path or query. Anything else is dropped. When several targets qualify, the one with
the fewest labels wins: that is ``name.account.workers.dev``, not a longer preview
host. A missing or unreadable URL is an error, because a deploy that succeeded and
then left no address cannot be smoke-tested.

``--preview`` reads the last ``"type": "preview"`` line instead and takes its
``preview_urls``. It prints ``url=`` for the workers.dev Preview URL, when there is
one, and ``custom_url=`` for the Preview's host under the production custom domain,
when Wrangler reported one. A Preview URL is accepted under the same https rules, on
a ``workers.dev`` host or on ``ai.szolotov.com`` or one of its subdomains. Wrangler
only reports the custom host once that domain is enabled for Preview traffic, so a
missing ``custom_url`` is for the caller to turn into an error, not for this script.

``--active`` reads the JSON ``wrangler deployments status --json`` prints instead: the
Worker's current production deployment. It prints ``version_id=`` for the version
serving all of its traffic, which is what a release rolls back to if its smoke test
fails. Without that ID ``wrangler rollback`` picks the version uploaded before the
newest one, which after an earlier failed release is that failed release, not what was
serving. A deployment that splits traffic between versions, a gradual rollout, has no
single version to return to and is an error: finish or revert the rollout first.

``--active-is VERSION_ID`` reads the same JSON and succeeds, printing ``version_id=``,
only when that version serves all of the traffic. A release uses it to prove the custom
domain serves the version it just deployed without fetching through the zone. Any
other version, a split, or an unreadable status is an error.
